🎨 Background Color Changer 🌈
Instantly change your webpage background just by typing colors!

✨ About the Project
This Background Color Changer is a simple and interactive web app that allows users to dynamically change the background color of the webpage by simply typing a color name (like red, blue, skyblue, green) or a valid hex code (like #ff5733) into an input box.
It’s a minimal yet powerful demonstration of how JavaScript can interactively modify page styling in real-time with just a few lines of code.

🧩 How It Works
The webpage has a centered input box.
As the user types and presses any key (onkeyup event), JavaScript instantly reads the value from the input field.
The background color of the page updates live to match the entered value!

onkeyup="document.bgColor=document.f.t.value"
